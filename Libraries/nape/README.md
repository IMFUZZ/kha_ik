# Where to download

Available on github are the .cx source-code requiring my caxe preprocessor.

From the Nape website (http://napephys.com) are available the the AS3 .swcs, manuals, samples and documentation.

From haxelib, you can also install nape with 'haxelib install nape' or when updating, 'haxelib upgrade'.

# Building from source

The supplied Makefile should work fine under *nix systems, commands will be near identical from windows command line, though mingw is probably easiest approach. Caxe will have to be built also, and compiling swcs requires my flib tool.
