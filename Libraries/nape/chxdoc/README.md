Modified version of caffeine-hx chxdoc: http://code.google.com/p/caffeine-hx/wiki/ChxDoc

The existing features of chxdoc were not sufficient for what I wanted in nape documentation, nor is the templating system entirely suitable for what I wanted to do.

For that reason I include a modified version of chxdoc here.
